# 13.5.1-A11-checkm8-exploit
A jailbreak that lets userland processes use tfp0.  
All you need to do after the phone has booted is call task_for_pid for any pid.  
  
There is an example app, ProcessViewer and a modified Chimera13.
You need to compile Chimera13 with the kernel slide the exploit will output to the screen before booting the modified kernel.
