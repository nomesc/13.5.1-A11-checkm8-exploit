# 13.5.1-A11-checkm8-exploit
An ultra basic jailbreak that lets userland processes use tfp0. It nukes task_for_pid and task_conversion_eval. Not the best solution.  
All you need to do after the phone has booted is call task_for_pid for any pid.  
  
There is an example app, ProcessViewer and a modified Chimera13.
You need to compile Chimera13 with the kernel slide the exploit will output to the screen before booting the modified kernel.  
  
To compile you need to call make in exploit. Also you need to compile macho-text tool and put in the path I wrote in the exploit makefile. You also need Xcode or you can chenge the maakefile to use whatever you want. You also need to run the exploit with sudo and have libusb installed. Yeah I know this repo is messy, but if anyone cares about this exploit I can tidy it all up.
